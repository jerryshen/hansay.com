title: Migrate Blog to Jekyll with Jekyll Extension
categories:
- Jekyll
---

I'm happy to see you guys, I built my own rails blog system about 3 years ago, but long time no updates with my blog. Since known about [Jekyll][0], a simple, blog aware, static site generator, It's cool to build a blog using jekyll without databases, that's great for me to write blog articles useing markdown format.

So I started to build my new blog system by Jekyll several days ago, but I got some problems about Jekyll extensions during the installation, with richard's help, it works, bye the way, you need to install the pyments for code highlight if you want to highlight your code. you can follow the [Jekyll Wiki][1] to get forward.

What I want for my blog system is not supported by default Jekyll, but I added some extensions according to [My Jekyll Extensions][2], It's really cool that we can build our categories section, monthly archive section, categroy page, monthly archive page without database now.

You can clone my Jekyll blog system [hansay.com][3] at [https://github.com/jerryshen/hansay.com][3].
