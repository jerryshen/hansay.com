> Style is what separates the good from the great. <br/>
> -- Bozhidar Batsov

One thing has always bothered me as Ruby developer - Python developers
have a great programming style reference
([PEP-8][0]) and we never got
an official guide, documenting Ruby coding style and best
practices. And I do believe that style matters. I also believe that
such fine fellows, like us Ruby developers, should be quite capable to
produce this coveted document.

This guide started its life as our internal company Ruby coding guidelines
(written by yours truly). At some point I decided that the work I was
doing might be interesting to members of the Ruby community in general
and that the world had little need for another internal company
guideline. But the world could certainly benefit from a
community-driven and community-sanctioned set of practices, idioms and
style prescriptions for Ruby programming.

Since the inception of the guide I've received a lot of feedback from
members of the exceptional Ruby community around the world. Thanks for
all the suggestions and the support! Together we can make a resource
beneficial to each and every Ruby developer out there.

By the way, if you're into Rails you might want to check out the
complementary
[Ruby on Rails 3 Style Guide][1].

# The Ruby Style Guide

This Ruby style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Ruby
programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Ruby
programmers. A style guide that reflects real-world usage gets used, and a
style guide that holds to an ideal that has been rejected by the people it is
supposed to help risks not getting used at all &ndash; no matter how good it is.

The guide is separated into several sections of related rules. I've
tried to add the rationale behind the rules (if it's omitted I've
assumed that is pretty obvious).

I didn't come up with all the rules out of nowhere - they are mostly
based on my extensive career as a professional software engineer,
feedback and suggestions from members of the Ruby community and
various highly regarded Ruby programming resources, such as
["Programming Ruby 1.9"][2]
and ["The Ruby Programming Language"][3].

The guide is still a work in progress - some rules are lacking
examples, some rules don't have examples that illustrate them clearly
enough. In due time these issues will be addressed - just keep them in
mind for now.

<a name="layout"></a>
## Source Code Layout

> Nearly everybody is convinced that every style but their own is
> ugly and unreadable. Leave out the "but their own" and they're
> probably right... <br/>
> -- Jerry Coffin (on indentation)

* Use `UTF-8` as the source file encoding.
* Use two **spaces** per indentation level.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # good
    def some_method
      do_something
    end

    # bad - four spaces
    def some_method
        do_something
    end
{% endhighlight %}


* Use Unix-style line endings. (*BSD/Solaris/Linux/OSX users are covered by default,
  Windows users have to be extra careful.)
    * If you're using Git you might want to add the following
    configuration setting to protect your project from Windows line
    endings creeping in: `$ git config --global core.autocrlf true`

* Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons, around `{`
  and before `}`. Whitespace might be (mostly) irrelevant to the Ruby
  interpreter, but its proper use is the key to writing easily
  readable code.

{% highlight ruby %}
    sum = 1 + 2
    a, b = 1, 2
    1 > 2 ? true : false; puts 'Hi'
    [1, 2, 3].each { |e| puts e }
{% endhighlight %}

    The only exception is when using the exponent operator:

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    e = M * c ** 2

    # good
    e = M * c**2
{% endhighlight %}

* No spaces after `(`, `[` or before `]`, `)`.

{% highlight ruby %}
    some(arg).other
    [1, 2, 3].length
{% endhighlight %}

* Indent `when` as deep as `case`. I know that many would disagree
  with this one, but it's the style established in both the "The Ruby
  Programming Language" and "Programming Ruby".

{% highlight ruby %}
    case
    when song.name == 'Misty'
      puts 'Not again!'
    when song.duration > 120
      puts 'Too long!'
    when Time.now.hour > 21
      puts "It's too late"
    else
      song.play
    end

    kind = case year
           when 1850..1889 then 'Blues'
           when 1890..1909 then 'Ragtime'
           when 1910..1929 then 'New Orleans Jazz'
           when 1930..1939 then 'Swing'
           when 1940..1950 then 'Bebop'
           else 'Jazz'
           end
{% endhighlight %}

* Use empty lines between `def`s and to break up a method into logical
  paragraphs.

{% highlight ruby %}
    def some_method
      data = initialize(options)

      data.manipulate!

      data.result
    end

    def some_method
      result
    end
{% endhighlight %}

* Use RDoc and its conventions for API documentation.  Don't put an
  empty line between the comment block and the `def`.
* Keep lines fewer than 80 characters.
* Avoid trailing whitespace.

<a name="syntax"></a>
## Syntax

* Use `def` with parentheses when there are arguments. Omit the
  parentheses when the method doesn't accept any arguments.

{% highlight ruby %}
   def some_method
     # body omitted
   end

   def some_method_with_arguments(arg1, arg2)
     # body omitted
   end
{% endhighlight %}

* Never use `for`, unless you know exactly why. Most of the time iterators
  should be used instead. `for` is implemented in terms of `each` (so
  you're adding a level of indirection), but with a twist - `for`
  doesn't introduce a new scope (unlike `each`) and variables defined
  in its block will be visible outside it.

{% highlight ruby %}
    arr = [1, 2, 3]

    # bad
    for elem in arr do
      puts elem
    end

    # good
    arr.each { |elem| puts elem }
{% endhighlight %}

* Never use `then` for multi-line `if/unless`.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    if some_condition then
      # body omitted
    end

    # good
    if some_condition
      # body omitted
    end
{% endhighlight %}

* Favor the ternary operator(`?:`) over `if/then/else/end` constructs.
  It's more common and obviously more concise.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    result = if some_condition then something else something_else end

    # good
    result = some_condition ? something : something_else
{% endhighlight %}

* Use one expression per branch in a ternary operator. This
  also means that ternary operators must not be nested. Prefer
  `if/else` constructs in these cases.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    some_condition ? (nested_condition ? nested_something : nested_something_else) : something_else

    # good
    if some_condition
      nested_condition ? nested_something : nested_something_else
    else
      something_else
    end
{% endhighlight %}

* Never use `if x: ...` - it is removed in Ruby 1.9. Use
  the ternary operator instead.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    result = if some_condition: something else something_else end

    # good
    result = some_condition ? something : something_else
{% endhighlight %}

* Never use `if x; ...`. Use the ternary operator instead.

* Use `when x then ...` for one-line cases. The alternative syntax
  `when x: ...` is removed in Ruby 1.9.

* Never use `when x; ...`. See the previous rule.

* Use `&&/||` for boolean expressions, `and/or` for control flow.  (Rule
  of thumb: If you have to use outer parentheses, you are using the
  wrong operators.)

{% highlight ruby %}
    # boolean expression
    if some_condition && some_other_condition
      do_something
    end

    # control flow
    document.saved? or document.save!
{% endhighlight %}

* Avoid multi-line `?:` (the ternary operator), use `if/unless` instead.

* Favor modifier `if/unless` usage when you have a single-line
  body. Another good alternative is the usage of control flow `and/or`.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    if some_condition
      do_something
    end

    # good
    do_something if some_condition

    # another good option
    some_condition and do_something
{% endhighlight %}

* Favor `unless` over `if` for negative conditions (or control
  flow `or`).

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    do_something if !some_condition

    # good
    do_something unless some_condition

    # another good option
    some_condition or do_something
{% endhighlight %}

* Never use `unless` with `else`. Rewrite these with the positive case first.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    unless success?
      puts 'failure'
    else
      puts 'success'
    end

    # good
    if success?
      puts 'success'
    else
      puts 'failure'
    end
{% endhighlight %}

* Don't use parentheses around the condition of an `if/unless/while`.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    if (x > 10)
      # body omitted
    end

    # good
    if x > 10
      # body omitted
    end
{% endhighlight %}

* Omit parentheses around parameters for methods that are part of an
  internal DSL (e.g. Rake, Rails, RSpec), methods that are with
  "keyword" status in Ruby (e.g. `attr_reader`, `puts`) and attribute
  access methods. Use parentheses around the arguments of all other
  method invocations.

{% highlight ruby %}
    class Person
      attr_reader name, age

      # omitted
    end

    temperance = Person.new('Temperance', 30)
    temperance.name

    puts temperance.age

    x = Math.sin(y)
    array.delete(e)
{% endhighlight %}

* Prefer `{...}` over `do...end` for single-line blocks.  Avoid using
  `{...}` for multi-line blocks (multiline chaining is always
  ugly). Always use `do...end` for "control flow" and "method
  definitions" (e.g. in Rakefiles and certain DSLs).  Avoid `do...end`
  when chaining.

{% highlight ruby %}
    names = ["Bozhidar", "Steve", "Sarah"]

    # good
    names.each { |name| puts name }

    # bad
    names.each do |name|
      puts name
    end

    # good
    names.select { |name| name.start_with?("S") }.map { |name| name.upcase }

    # bad
    names.select do |name|
      name.start_with?("S")
    end.map { |name| name.upcase }
{% endhighlight %}

    Some will argue that multiline chaining would look OK with the use of {...}, but they should
    ask themselves - it this code really readable and can't the blocks contents be extracted into
    nifty methods.

* Avoid `return` where not required.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    def some_method(some_arr)
      return some_arr.size
    end

    # good
    def some_method(some_arr)
      some_arr.size
    end
{% endhighlight %}

* Use spaces around the `=` operator when assigning default values to method parameters:

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    def some_method(arg1=:default, arg2=nil, arg3=[])
      # do something...
    end

    # good
    def some_method(arg1 = :default, arg2 = nil, arg3 = [])
      # do something...
    end
{% endhighlight %}

    While several Ruby books suggest the first style, the second is much more prominent
    in practice (and arguably a bit more readable).

* Avoid line continuation (\\) where not required. In practice, avoid using
  line continuations at all.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    result = 1 - \
             2

    # good (but still ugly as hell)
    result = 1 \
             - 2
{% endhighlight %}

* Using the return value of `=` (an assignment) is ok.

{% highlight ruby %}
    if v = array.grep(/foo/) ...
{% endhighlight %}

* Use `||=` freely to initialize variables.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # set name to Bozhidar, only if it's nil or false
    name ||= 'Bozhidar'
{% endhighlight %}

* Don't use `||=` to initialize boolean variables. (Consider what
would happen if the current value happened to be `false`.)

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad - would set enabled to true even if it was false
    enabled ||= true

    # good
    enabled = true if enabled.nil?
{% endhighlight %}

* Avoid using Perl-style special variables (like `$0-9`, `$``,
  etc. ). They are quite cryptic and their use in anything but
  one-liner scripts is discouraged.

* Never put a space between a method name and the opening parenthesis.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    f (3 + 2) + 1

    # good
    f(3 + 2) + 1
{% endhighlight %}

* If the first argument to a method begins with an open parenthesis,
  always use parentheses in the method invocation. For example, write
`f((3 + 2) + 1)`.

* Always run the Ruby interpreter with the `-w` option so it will warn
  you if you forget either of the rules above!

<a name="naming"></a>
## Naming

> The only real difficulties in programming are cache invalidation and
> naming things. <br/>
> -- Phil Karlton

* Use `snake_case` for methods and variables.
* Use `CamelCase` for classes and modules.  (Keep acronyms like HTTP,
  RFC, XML uppercase.)
* Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for other constants.
* The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value)
  should end in a question mark.
  (i.e. `Array#empty?`).
* The names of potentially "dangerous" methods (i.e. methods that modify `self` or the
  arguments, `exit!`, etc.) should end with an exclamation mark.
* When using `inject` with short blocks, name the arguments `|a, e|`
  (accumulator, element).
* When defining binary operators, name the argument `other`.

{% highlight ruby %}
    def +(other)
      # body omitted
    end
{% endhighlight %}

* Prefer `map` over *collect*, `find` over *detect*, `select` over
  *find_all*, `size` over *length*. This is not a hard requirement; if the
  use of the alias enhances readability, it's ok to use it.

<a name="comments"></a>
## Comments

> Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a
> comment, ask yourself, "How can I improve the code so that this
> comment isn't needed?" Improve the code and then document it to make
> it even clearer. <br/>
> -- Steve McConnell

* Write self-documenting code and ignore the rest of this section. Seriously!
* Comments longer than a word are capitalized and use punctuation. Use [one
  space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing) after periods.
* Avoid superfluous comments.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    counter += 1 # increments counter by one
{% endhighlight %}

* Keep existing comments up-to-date. No comment is better than an outdated
  comment.
* Avoid writing comments to explain bad code. Refactor the code to
  make it self-explanatory. (Do or do not - there is no try.)

<a name="annotations"/>
## Annotations

* Annotations should usually be written on the line immediately above
  the relevant code.
* The annotation keyword is followed by a colon and a space, then a note
  describing the problem.
* If multiple lines are required to describe the problem, subsequent
  lines should be indented two spaces after the `#`.

{% highlight ruby %}
    def bar
      # FIXME: This has crashed occasionally since v3.2.1. It may
      #   be related to the BarBazUtil upgrade.
      baz(:quux)
    end
{% endhighlight %}

* In cases where the problem is so obvious that any documentation would
  be redundant, annotations may be left at the end of the offending line
  with no note. This usage should be the exception and not the rule.

{% highlight ruby %}
    def bar
      sleep 100 # OPTIMIZE
    end
{% endhighlight %}

* Use `TODO` to note missing features or functionality that should be
  added at a later date.
* Use `FIXME` to note broken code that needs to be fixed.
* Use `OPTIMIZE` to note slow or inefficient code that may cause
  performance problems.
* Use `HACK` to note code smells where questionable coding practices
  were used and should be refactored away.
* Use `REVIEW` to note anything that should be looked at to confirm it
  is working as intended. For example: `REVIEW: Are we sure this is how the
  client does X currently?`
* Use other custom annotation keywords if it feels appropriate, but be
  sure to document them in your project's `README` or similar.

<a name="classes"></a>
## Classes

* Always supply a proper `to_s` method.

{% highlight ruby %}
    class Person
      attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end

      def to_s
        "#@first_name #@last_name"
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

* Use the `attr` family of functions to define trivial accessors or
  mutators.
* Consider adding factory methods to provide additional sensible ways
  to create instances of a particular class.
* Prefer duck-typing over inheritance.
* Avoid the usage of class (`@@`) variables due to their "nasty" behavior
  in inheritance.
* Assign proper visibility levels to methods (`private`, `protected`)
in accordance with their intended usage. Don't go off leaving
everything `public` (which is the default). After all we're coding
in *Ruby* now, not in *Python*.
* Indent the `public`, `protected`, and `private` methods as much the
  method definitions they apply to. Leave one blank line above them.

{% highlight ruby %}
    class SomeClass
      def public_method
        # ...
      end

      private
      def private_method
        # ...
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

* Use `def self.method` to define singleton methods. This makes the methods
  more resistant to refactoring changes.

{% highlight ruby %}
    class TestClass
      # bad
      def TestClass.some_method
        # body omitted
      end

      # good
      def self.some_other_method
        # body omitted
      end

      # Also possible and convenient when you
      # have to define many singleton methods.
      class << self
        def first_method
          # body omitted
        end

        def second_method_etc
          # body omitted
        end
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="exceptions"></a>
## Exceptions

* Don't suppress exceptions.
* Don't use exceptions for flow of control.
* Avoid rescuing the `Exception` class.

<a name="collections"></a>
## Collections

* It's ok to use arrays as sets for a small number of elements.
* Prefer `%w` to the literal array syntax when you need an array of
strings.
* Avoid the creation of huge gaps in arrays.
* Use `Set` instead of `Array` when dealing with lots of elements.
* Use symbols instead of strings as hash keys.
* Avoid the use of mutable object as hash keys.
* Use the new 1.9 literal hash syntax in preference to the hashrocket syntax.
* Rely on the fact that hashes in 1.9 are ordered.
* Never modify a collection while traversing it.

<a name="strings"></a>
## Strings

* Prefer string interpolation instead of string concatenation:

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    email_with_name = user.name + ' <' + user.email + '>'

    # good
    email_with_name = "#{user.name} <#{user.email}>"
{% endhighlight %}

* Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or
  special symbols such as `\t`, `\n`, `'`, etc.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    name = "Bozhidar"

    # good
    name = 'Bozhidar'
{% endhighlight %}

* Don't use `{}` around instance variables being interpolated into a
  string.

{% highlight ruby %}
    class Person
      attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end

      # bad
      def to_s
        "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
      end

      # good
      def to_s
        "#@first_name #@last_name"
      end
    end
{% endhighlight %}

* Avoid using `String#+` when you need to construct large data chunks.
  Instead, use `String#<<`. Concatenation mutates the string instance in-place
  and is always faster than `String#+`, which creates a bunch of new string objects.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # good and also fast
    html = ''
    html << '<h1>Page title</h1>'

    paragraphs.each do |paragraph|
      html << "<p>#{paragraph}</p>"
    end
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="literals"/></a>
## Percent Literals

* Use `%w` freely.

{% highlight ruby %}
    STATES = %w(draft open closed)
{% endhighlight %}

* Use `%()` for single-line strings which require both interpolation
  and embedded double-quotes. For multi-line strings, prefer heredocs.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad (no interpolation needed)
    %(<div class="text">Some text</div>)
    # should be '<div class="text">Some text</div>'

    # bad (no double-quotes)
    %(This is #{quality} style)
    # should be "This is #{quality} style"

    # bad (multiple lines)
    %(<div>\n<span class="big">#{exclamation}</span>\n</div>)
    # should be a heredoc.

    # good (requires interpolation, has quotes, single line)
    %(<tr><td class="name">#{name}</td>)
{% endhighlight %}

* Use `%r` only for regular expressions matching *more than* one '/' character.

{% highlight ruby %}
    # bad
    %r(\s+)

    # still bad
    %r(^/(.*)$)
    # should be /^\/(.*)$/

    # good
    %r(^/blog/2011/(.*)$)
{% endhighlight %}

* Avoid `%q`, `%Q`, `%x`, `%s`, and `%W`.

* Prefer `()` as delimiters for all `%` literals.

<a name="misc"/></a>
## Misc

* Write `ruby -w` safe code.
* Avoid hashes as optional parameters. Does the method do too much?
* Avoid methods longer than 10 LOC (lines of code). Ideally, most methods will be shorter than
  5 LOC. Empty lines do not contribute to the relevant LOC.
* Avoid parameter lists longer than three or four parameters.
* If you really have to, add "global" methods to Kernel and make them private.
* Use class instance variables instead of global variables.

{% highlight ruby %}
    #bad
    $foo_bar = 1

    #good
    class Foo
      class << self
        attr_accessor :bar
      end
    end

    Foo.bar = 1
{% endhighlight %}

* Avoid `alias` when `alias_method` will do.
* Use `OptionParser` for parsing complex command line options and
  `ruby -s` for trivial command line options.
* Write for Ruby 1.9. Don't use legacy Ruby 1.8 constructs.
    * Use the new JavaScript literal hash syntax.
    * Use the new lambda syntax.
    * Methods like `inject` now accept method names as arguments.

  {% highlight ruby %}
      [1, 2, 3].inject(:+)
  {% endhighlight %}

* Avoid needless metaprogramming.

<a name="design"/></a>
## Design

* Code in a functional way, avoiding mutation when that makes sense.
* Do not mutate arguments unless that is the purpose of the method.
* Do not mess around in core classes when writing libraries. (Do not monkey
  patch them.)
* [Do not program
  defensively.](http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml#HDR11)
* Keep the code simple and subjective. Each method should have a single,
  well-defined responsibility.
* Avoid more than three levels of block nesting.
* Don't overdesign. Overly complex solutions tend to be brittle and hard to
  maintain.
* Don't underdesign. A solution to a problem should be as simple as
  possible, but no simpler than that. Poor initial design can lead to a lot
  of problems in the future.
* Be consistent. In an ideal world, be consistent with these guidelines.
* Use common sense.
